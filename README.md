# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a dataset containing housing data from the Nashville, TN area using SQL Server. The goal was to transform the raw data into a cleaner and more usable format, making it suitable for analysis and further processing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various details about housing in Nashville, including addresses, dates, and other property-related information.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the data cleaning process were to:

- Convert dates to a standardized format by removing unnecessary timestamps.
- Populate missing values to ensure the dataset is complete.
- Split address information into separate columns for address, city, and state.
- Standardize inconsistent data representations.
- Remove duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
- Delete unused columns to streamline the dataset.

## Project Steps

The following steps were performed using SQL Server:

### Importing the Data:

  - The dataset is imported into SQL Server for processing.

### Date Conversion

  - Converted dates to remove unnecessary timestamps.

### Handling Null Values

  - Populated missing data for null values to ensure completeness.

### Address Column Transformation

   - Split the address column into separate columns for address, city, and state.

### Data Standardization

  - Standardized different representations of the same data to ensure consistency.

### Duplicate Removal

  - Identified and removed duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.

### Unused Column Deletion

  - Deleted columns that were not used in the analysis to simplify the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing in preparing datasets for analysis. By using SQL Server to perform various cleaning tasks, the Nashville housing data is now in a more usable state, allowing for more accurate and efficient analysis.
